# data-star-modal Demo

## Description

This repository contains a minimal reproducible example of an issue I'm encountering with implementing a modal with datastar.

## The Issue

When the modal is:
1. Opened for the first time: Works correctly
2. Closed for the first time: Works correctly
3. Opened for the second time: Opens correctly but the click outside event is triggered when a user types inside the input box inside the modal

## Live Demo

I've deployed a website so people can view the issue for themselves. You can access the live broken demo here: [data-star-modal Demo](https://modal-datastar-demo.fly.dev/)
